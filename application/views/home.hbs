<!--
        home.html will be used to show results form an AJAX call
        made to a fake API. 
            - max 5 photos, min 3 photos per row.
            - all photos same size
            - each object shows photo and title
            - photos can be fetched with button press or when html loads.
            - may use XMLHTTPRequest_object, fetch API, or axios to retrieve photos.
            - page should handle any num of posts.
            - after the photos on bottom or top of page, display num photos being displayed.
            - add onclick event to each photo container. 
                - onclick, photo fades out over time (choose speed)
                - After fadeout, remove element from DOM.
                - after removing div, decrement photo count to current photos shown.
